Simple Wake on Lan is a simple cross-platform flutter application for Android to send Wake On Lan packets to a device.

## Usage
Wake on LAN (WoL) is a network protocol that allows a device to be turned on or awakened remotely
over a network while it is sleeping. This project aims to make the process of waking devices easy with a mobile application.

## Features

- Automatic device discovery
- Simple interface to send Wake On Lan packets
- Export and import user data as a `json` file (see below)

The app stores the added devices in a `json` file which can be exported and imported within the app UI. An example of the file structure is shown below:
```json
